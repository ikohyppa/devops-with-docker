* I used my high-low-dice project.
* The project has two publicgit repos:
    - https://github.com/ikohyppa/high-low-dice-server
    - https://github.com/ikohyppa/high-low-dice-client

* I added Dockerfile to both and docker-compose.yml to server repo.
* Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml can be found here in BE and FE directories.
* Repos should be cloned under a common directory.
* Then in server directory command 'docker-compose up' starts both server and client in development state.
