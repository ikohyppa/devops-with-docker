I used my randon-button project I created for exercise 1.15.
https://github.com/ikohyppa/random-button/blob/main/Dockerfile
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ikohyppa/random-button

Dockerfile.before is the original Dockerfile and Dockerfile.after is the optimized one.
Docker image size difference was 465MB
